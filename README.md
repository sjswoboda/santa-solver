# Santa Solver

A personal project to figure out who my Santa is in our annual family Secret Santa. There are exclusions (no spouses, can't have same people until everyone's had everyone...etc.)

## How to use it

Start with entering the name of everyone who is participating in your Secret Santa.
Then start entering "exclusions" and "facts". Exclusions are people who cannot have each other. Facts are Santa and recipients you already know-- for example, you know who you have. (And you might know who your spouse has. And someone else may have let slip who they have.)
